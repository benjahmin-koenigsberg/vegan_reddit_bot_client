selftext : ` "I see it everywhere now.  At the butcher for $99 a pound. At Costco ffs. I ate at a nice steakhouse the other night that had "American dry-aged Wagyu ribeye" on the menu for $140. Server talked my ear off about how it came from some magical organic cattle ranch in Idaho and was sole sourced from there.  This was in Houston mind you,  where you can still get an amazing ribeye for $40-$50. I politely declined the sales pitch and ordered a normal,  non-Wagyu ribeye and it was fantastic. I thought Wagyu comes from Japan and they literally give beer to the cows and give them massages every day. "American Wagyu Ribeye" sounds like a marketing gimmick to me. So for those of you who have experienced this expensive luxurious delicacy, is it worth it?" `
