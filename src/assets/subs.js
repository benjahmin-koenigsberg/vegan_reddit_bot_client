author_fullname : "t2_cc1lmkqq",
selftext : "We recently purchased a 4lb bacon wrapped stuffed boneless chicken along with 4 1lb boneless skinless chicken breasts stuffed with goat cheese. We want to cook everything at the same time and the staff at the butcher said it takes 40 min per pound at 350 degrees and we have 8lb total which would make it just over 5 hours. This seems very long for chicken and from what I have read you can cook many pounds of chicken in bulk and it only takes 40-50 minutes.Does anybody have experience with cooking chicken like this and the time it takes?Thank you"

title : "DECENT knife sets on Amazon?",
author : 'piexe',
selftext : `"I was hoping someone could give me an honest recommendations for a DECENT knife set on Amazon. My budget is about $100-$150 dollars. Would optimally include a few steak knives, a large multi-purpose chef's knife, a bread knife, and a paring knife. PLEASE do NOT just say "don't buy a knife set." That's not helpful. That's all I see on Reddit. I get it, but listen. I WANT a knife set. I LIKE knife sets. I'm a casual cook on a budget. I own a knife sharpener so I don't need any fancy Japanese steel chef knives - I really just want to slightly upgrade from my Amazon no-name brand knife set that's actually served me well for 3 years. End rant."`

Then I put in 5 scoops of bread flower and a little bit of olive oil. then I kept stirring the dough while putting in flower so it isn't sticky. then I put it in the fridge all day and made pizza with it."

  selftext: 'My boyfriend (30M) and I (25F) have been dating for about a year and a half now. We’ve had our ups and downs but overall we love eachother a lot and get along pretty well. He has a tendency to talk a lot about himself, which i don’t normally mind. It has been an issue in our relationship recently though because anytime we talk he makes the conversation about himself. When i talk about myself or a situation that happened, he’ll bring up something that he’s thinking (about himself). I started to notice that he doesn’t pay attention to me when i’m talking which is obviously a huge issue. I will ask him to repeat what i said and he’ll have no idea. Well this morning i was having a panic attack and i texted him that i wasn’t feeling well. he called me about an hour later and tells me i won’t believe what his friend did and i got really angry because i was in the middle of a panic attack and wanted comfort not to gossip about his friend. he claims he never saw my text but kind of just brushed it off. It’s also important to mention my bf has ADHD so he tends to not let you finish speaking (i have ADHD as well and don’t take medication anymore but i try to make a conscious effort not to interrupt people when they speak because i’ve had people call me out). I don’t know what to do because we also just recently signed a lease for an apartment to move in at the end of this month. I love him very much so i don’t want to break up with him but i need advice on weather this is something break up worthy or something we can fix. Has anyone had similar issues in their relationship?',
