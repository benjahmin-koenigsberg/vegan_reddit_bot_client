    selftext:
      "*I believe that sometimes it is important to trace comparisons between different fields in order to invite different people into the conversation.  Hopefully this makes sense * The medical field has been redefining what is the true command center of the body. Throughout modern times it has been argued that it is the brain that guided the body through the thought process and the peripheral nervous system. Lately, it was discovered that the gut and the central nervous system created a feedback loop that auto regulates each other through the interaction between the pituitary gland and the micro biome. It is also known that the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are regulated alongside the cardio-respiratory response, allowing consciousness to modulate the pace at which we breath and the emotional response of the body. This scientific based knowledge now offers some insight as to why it why there‚Äôs fluttering hearts and visceral responses. The central and peripheral nerviosa systems are continually processing and storing information from external experiences. At the same time, the brain has the ability to modulate the responses through the thought process, the mind is consciously experiencing itself at all times. If the experience is a constant feedback loop then it is possible to find the the courage to change the thought process on the experience of the consciousness. There are two pathways in which spirituality deals with this sense of awareness. The most common path is through existential nihilism that is easily explained by the law of attraction. The LAO allows people to go in  search for their life purpose and you will attract that purpose (often described as value) into your life. The less common pathway is metaphysical nihilism, in which it is believed that for every object that exists, there might have been a world where it doesn‚Äôt exist. The LOA states that by believing that you exist in the reality where you have the things that you want, they will align with you. What separates us from experiencing the life we want? just one thought?",
