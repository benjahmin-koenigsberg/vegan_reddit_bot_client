Very much appreciated when it’s made correctly. And I’m so glad I did so tonight. My dad allowed me to make it by myself. I used gloves to make it this time as I’ve been weary about cleanliness. This and cabbage rolls are some of my favourites. Currently writing up a recipe journal. I’m thinking I added too much ground black pepper, but then I’m also eating this with some guindilla peppers.",

For example, dried mushrooms, pasteurized cream and dry pasta gets you a nice creamy mushroom pasta and the only perishable ingredient is the cream (that can be stored in the fridge for months). Ingredients can be frozen too if it's not necessary to thaw them. For example, frozen fries can be cooked in the oven in 20 mins without thawing. Thank you!
