The bread does not have any visible mold and is, to be frank, still quite soft. It smells exactly like the same brand of rye bread always smells when i buy it. However I just looked at the date sticker and it says best before March 2 and, well, i didnt freeze and unfreeze it, its just been in the breadbox that long. I don't move through bread as quickly as I used to because I apparently get my daily gluten intake from beer. Is there any reason I should not give this bread to my child? No mold, doesn't look or taste stale. Is there some secret danger in the rye bread, some insidious pathogen I'm unaware of that i should be before I wrap this sandwich in tinfoil for tomorrow's lunch? Thank u in advance",

      "So I was going to throw a pork roast into my slow cooker but the rost has some... Interesting colouration on the inside and outside. There's dark/reddish gray areas that extend into the inside of the roast, as well as gray areas on much of the surface. It was frozen for a couple months prior, and put it in the fridge to defrost for a few days prior to now (would probably have finished defrosting 2 days ago, but I got busy and couldn't cook it). It doesn't smell like ammonia or anything, though areas near fat or bone smell vaguely like wet dog smell... It is seriously sketching me out as I've had bad food poisoning before and am in the middle of exams (so that would be disastrous). But the idea of chucking like 2kg of meat into the trash is not something I'd want to do unless I'm certain that it's off. I'll link some photos on imgur, though my camera is not great and the saturation makes the color differences in the meat look a lot less pronounced. https://imgur.com/a/2kvb10M",

Defrosting meat would be at room temperature to be cooked that day (unless it was a turkey or something big). Storing leftovers in the fridge was an option but definitely not required. None of us ever got sick, maybe helped by the fact we lived in a dry cold climate and bugs weren't a problem? Just curious if anyone else grew up like this or still does this.

Many different companies, including Amazon Basics, use the exact same photo with their logo added on to the stone.
