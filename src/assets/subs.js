I am thinking of cooking up a exotic Middle Eastern feast with all these organ meats but the problem is, I have no idea how to cook ‘em all up. Perhaps some chefs specializing in the cuisine of the Levant and Anatolia could help me figure out how to cook an organ doner. Thanks",

For example, I've read some good reviews and articles about the Sharp Pebble stones.  However, when you search them all on Amazon, the listings seem very sketchy.  Many different companies, including Amazon Basics, use the exact same photo with their logo added on to the stone.  It looks like it's a generic stone from an unknown company, that other companies just slap their logo on and call it their own.  The prices vary wildly too.  Every review also says something like Good stone, but I would never use it on My Whustof/Global knives  My knives right now are rather cheap, but I want to make sure its a great stone, because I plan on investing in some Whustof or Global knives soon.
